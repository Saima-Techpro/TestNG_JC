        chatGPT:

        If you just need to run specific groups in a particular test suite, the second approach (<run>) is sufficient and simpler.
        If you want to create more complex test groupings, or you have multiple tests to run under a single logical group
        (i.e., grouping existing groups into one new group), the approach (<define>) is more powerful.
        Overall, the (<run>) approach  is more commonly used for straightforward test runs,
        while the (<define>) approach  is beneficial for more complex scenarios involving the combination of multiple
        groups from multiple classes.

<!--        NOTE1: groups tag should be used first and then packages tag

            NOTE2: We must use <packages>, <package> tags with "myApp.tests.*" because we need to
             tell the address of where to look for this group called "Regression Suite"
             Basically we are telling our xml file that go to ALL packages, look at ALL test methods
             whichever has "Regression Suite" group mentioned, run that test -->
